# Gain Assist

This plugin will allow control of up to 10 Gain components. 

In the properties, choose how many gains are needed, and set the min and max dB per gain.

In the plugin, link each UCI fader to a Gain component's Code Name. Add a "Friendly Name" to each respective UCI fader.

The Display Name will always show the Friendly Name.

If Text Override is enabled, the Display dB and Display % will show the respective values upon a fader change, and then revert back to the friendly name. If Text Override is disabled, they will always show the dB and % readout of the respective fader.

Audio inputs are exposed for each respective fader. These audio inputs are exposed to the plugin's meter for each respective fader.
